Install ANsible:
=================

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get install ansible -y
ansible --version

==========================================

=============================================================
Configuration Management : Ansible:
==================================================



Check Ansible Installation:
*****************************
$ ansible --version

Ad Hoc Commands in Ansible
==========================

           These are ansible direct commands.
When we have a single module to be executed on host servers, we use adhoc commands
Whenever we want to quickly check a result or a file or a change on the host servers, we can use adhoc command.
When we have multiple modules to be executed, we cannot use adhoc command
It is just a single command which cannot be reused.

Syntax:

# ansible host -m modulename -a “argument”


Ping module: trivial module, used with adhoc commands
==========
Check ⇒ if ansible is able connect with host and it will check python configuration on all hosts

# ansible localhost -m ping

Command module:
# ansible localhost -m command -a  "uptime"

# ansible localhost -m command -a “df -h”


Introduction to YAML:
===========================

Ansible playbook are written in YAML

YAML is not a programming language, scripting language

It is a fileformat used to save data like json or XML

YAML files save data in form of key and value

It is declarative in nature

The extension of YAML file is .yml or .YAML

YAML syntax

key: value

key: name of the key is given by the tool
value: will be given by the user

Write YAML synatx which store single value:

Playbook to deploy an HTML code on Apache webserver
=========================================

# sudo su -

# cd /etc/ansible

# sudo  vim playbook1.yml

Press i 

and enter below code


- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: update repo command
    command: apt update
  - name: Install package apache2
    package: name=apache2 state=present


And save the file

# ansible-playbook playbook1.yml --syntax-check

#  ansible-playbook playbook1.yml



Continus the scenario:
===========================
$ pwd   ⇒ /etc/ansible

$ sudo vim index.html

 Write any text and save the file

<h1> this file is from ansible </h1>
<h1> created by </h1>


Save the file

The complete playbook is:




- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: update repo
    command: apt update -y
  - name: Install a package apache2
    apt: name=apache2 state=present
  - name: Start apache2 service
    service: name=apache2 state=started
  - name: Deploy index.html file
    copy: src=index.html dest=/var/www/html
  - name: restart apache2 server
    service: name=apache2 state=restarted


Execute the playbook

# ansible-playbook playbook1.yml

Go to browser of lab and give

localhost:80

Assignment:
=====================================
Establish SSH connection controller machine and host machine:
*************************
Establish SSH key pair in linux system to have SSH connectivity with localhost using the following commands:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa (Press Enter when asked for File and Paraphrase details)

$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys

[OR] when connecting with public server host

$ ssh-copy-id -i username@ipHost

Add the host ‘localhost’  in ansible host file:

$ vim /etc/ansible/hosts


[webservers]
localhost:42006
ipaddress


=================================================================
Terraform:
========================================================

Setup Terraform:

Execute below command to install terraform:

# sudo su -

#  wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.5.5/terraform_1.5.5_linux_amd64.zip


[Optional]
Instal unzip package if it is not available on your lab

$ sudo apt-get install -y unzip   → [Optional]


Unzip the terraform_1.4.6_linux_amd64.zip file

# unzip terraform_1.5.5_linux_amd64.zip

$ ls

Move terraform to bin directory

$ sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

Verify:
$ terraform --version



=========================================================

User creation in AWS and create accesskey and secret key for it.

========================================================


We will use this accesskey and secret key in the terraform configuration file.
======================================================

You will be connected to AWS management:

In the search box, give IAM and select it.

You will be on IAM dashboard

On the left side→ click on Users→ Click on ADD user button →under user details give User name as Terraform → click on next →select 3rd option Attach policies directly →scroll down and from list click on AdministratorAccess →Scroll down → click next → scroll down and click on Create User.

Click on the user name Terraform →Click on security credentials tab→ scroll down to access key→ click on create access key→Click on Command Line Interface (CLI) → Scroll down→Select the box of→ I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key. → click on next → click on create access key

Copy the access key : AKIAUJU24ZR34LFZE2ZH
Coppy and secret key: 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

=========================================================



Demo 1:
===============================
             Connect and authenticate terraform with the AWS provider.
===============================
Terraform code is always written in block format
The first block that you will see in main terraform file is provider block

This block consist of following information:

> name of the provider
> region where we want to create infrastructure
> access key and secret key to connect AWS securely

For this create a directory on the lab:

# mkdir myterraformfiles

# cd myterraformfiles

# vim awsinstance.tf

provider "aws" {

  region     = "us-east-1"

  access_key = "AKIAUJU24ZR3XTD4A6PC"

  secret_key = "pu9vAfIuO//K5vgX5Ty5z+IqZjvCKrH/fZKZ+1eS"

}


Note: replace access key and secret key with your values.

Save the file and execute below command:

# terraform init

Registry link : https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs


Demo2:
==========================================================
Create an ec2 instance in AWS using terraform:

EC2 creation in AWS is a resource for terraform
We are learning now → terraform resource block

EC2 resource creation in AWS requires:

Name and tags
Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image) Info

Ami-09538990a0c4fe9be

Instance type : t2.micro

Key pair (login)

Network → Firewall (security groups)


Registry link : https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance

The full code of terraform with provider and resource:
================================================

provider "aws" {

  region     = "us-east-1"

  access_key = "AKIAUJU24ZR3XTD4A6PC"

  secret_key = "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"

}

resource "aws_instance" "myec2"{

 ami = "ami-09538990a0c4fe9be"
 instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {

    Name = "terraform demo"

  }


}


Execute below commands

# terraform validate

# terraform plan

# terraform apply

To delete the resource using terraform

# terraform destroy
