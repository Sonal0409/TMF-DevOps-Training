$ history

Become the root user:
$ sudo su -

Print working directory
     
           $ pwd



Create a empty directory on your lab
$ mkdir myfiles
$ ls → check if directory got created or not

Go inside a directory

Create a empty file inside the directory

Modify permission of a file
============================
 
3 permissions are given to a file

r : read   ===>  4
w: write    ⇒ 2
x: executable  ===> 1
- : no permissions ⇒ 0
Permissions are same for files and directories

3 types of  users in linux for  a files

u: User who created the file

g: the Group name of the user that created the file

o: All the other users in linux system

a: for all users+group+other

Example:

-rw-r--r--  1 root root  689 Feb 11 16:22 file1

rw-  : read write permission to the user
r--  : only read permission to group user
r--:  only read permission to other user in linux




Change permission of a file for main user of the file

Give executable permission to main user

$ chmod u+x file1

$ ls -al

-rwxrw-r--  1 mittalsonal04gm mittalsonal04gm   13 May  8 17:00 file1

Change permission of a file for group user of the file

Give executable permission to main user

$ chmod g+x file1

$ ls -al

$ chmod a+x file1

$ ls -al

Remove permissions

chmod g-x file1


$ chmod 666 file1

6 ⇒ 4+2 (read & write) ⇒ owner
6 ⇒  4+2 (read & write) ⇒ group
6 ⇒  4+2 (read & write) ⇒ all


==============================

Read permission  = 4
Write permission = 2
Execute = 1

If we have to give read and write permission to user, group and other

chmod 666 file1

If we have to read permission to only user. No permission to group and other

chmod 400 file1

If we want to give all permission to user, group and others

chmod 777 file1

============================================

Install a package on the linux OS -> ubuntu

$ cd   ===> you will on the root directory
   	$  apt-get install tree

You have to be a root user
$ sudo su -    ⇒ change current user to super user user(root)

To change any other user

su mittalsonal04gm


Create a user in linux OS

$ useradd alice

To see details of different users on the OS

$ cat /etc/passwd

Delete a user

$ userdel alice
